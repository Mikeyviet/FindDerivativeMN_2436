 * @Course  COSC 2436
 * @Assign. Quiz 2 Extra Credit (Problem 1)
 * @Description Write a program to help find the derivative of polynomial expressions 
 *      with simple powers (no negative or fractional exponents). 
 *      The rules of finding a derivative are the following:
 * 
 *          • If the expression is a constant value, the derivative is zero.
 *          • If the expression is any power in the form AX^N, where is A is a 
 *              positive or negative integer, and N is any positive integer, the 
 *              derivative is equal to A times N, times X raised to the power of N-1, 
 *              or ANX^(N-1).
 *          • The derivative of a sum of multiple operands is the sum of the derivatives of each operand.
 *      
 *      The program must implement the linked list data structure to store the polynomial expression. 
 *      program must also implement a stack
